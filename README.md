# Multi-armed-Bandit
The "10-armed bandit" is a concept in reinforcement learning and statistics often used to explain and explore the exploration-exploitation trade-off. The name comes from the analogy of a gambler facing a row of 10 slot machines (bandits), each with different payout probabilities (arms).
